## Data Cleaning Projects Overview

In this above projects, my primary focus was to clean and transform raw data to prepare it for data visualization and analysis. The following key highlights summarize the project's main objectives and the SQL skills and operations employed:

## Objective

- **Data Preparation**: We aimed to prepare raw data for data visualization and analysis.

## Key Highlights

1. **Connecting to Databases**: We established connections to relevant databases using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

2. **Data Cleaning Skills and Operations**: We employed a range of SQL skills and operations to clean and transform the data:

    - **SELECT**: Used to retrieve specific data from tables, enabling us to filter and extract necessary information.

    - **UPDATE**: Employed to modify existing data, making corrections or updates to records when required.

    - **DELETE**: Utilized to remove unnecessary or obsolete records, improving data quality and reducing redundancy.

    - **WHERE Clause**: Implemented WHERE clauses to filter and conditionally select data based on specified criteria.

    - **PARSENAME**: Employed to parse and extract specific parts of data, particularly in scenarios where data needed to be broken down into smaller components.

    - **CHARINDEX**: Utilized the CHARINDEX function to find the position of characters within a string, facilitating the identification and extraction of relevant data.

    - **Data Transformation**: Applied various data transformation techniques, such as string manipulation, date formatting, and numeric conversions, to standardize data formats.

    - **Aggregation**: Employed aggregation functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) to summarize and consolidate data for reporting and analysis.

    - **CASE Statements**: Utilized CASE statements to conditionally modify data based on specified criteria.

    - **Data Imputation**: Applied techniques for data imputation to handle missing or null values by replacing them with appropriate data.

    - **Data Deduplication**: Identified and removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

    - **Data Enrichment**: Augmented datasets with additional information or calculated values where necessary.

    - **Data Sorting**: Utilized the ORDER BY clause to sort data in ascending or descending order, facilitating data presentation and analysis.

    - **Data Joining**: Employed SQL JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables or sources for comprehensive analysis.

    - **Data Validation**: Implemented validation checks to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data.

    - **Batch Processing**: Performed batch processing of data to efficiently clean and update large datasets.

This project has successfully transformed raw data into a clean, structured form that is now ready for data visualization and analysis.
